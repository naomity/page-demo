Constructed computer vision models based on U-Net and GAN for multi-organ semantic segmentation on chest X-Rays and obtained a dice point of 0.97 on JSRT dataset, helped doctors identify target area and benefited downstream tasks including heat map generation and classification.

Implemented pneumonia classification algorithm that achieved accuracy over 0.96, contributing to a hospital project that detects lung infection in chest X-rays efficiently during Covid-19 screening.
